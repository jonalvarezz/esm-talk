## Credits
Presentation roadmap was mainly ~~copied~~ inspired from the blog entry [Native ECMAScript modules - the first overview by Serg Hospodarets](https://blog.hospodarets.com/native-ecmascript-modules-the-first-overview).

This is a [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) presentation, built with [generator-bespoke](https://github.com/markdalgleish/generator-bespoke).
